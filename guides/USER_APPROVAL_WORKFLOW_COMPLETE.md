# User Approval Workflow Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Registration Process Updated
- New users are created with `status: 'pending'` instead of `status: 'active'`
- Users are NOT automatically logged in after registration
- Registration returns a message indicating admin approval is required

### 2. Login System Enhanced
- Added status checks during login process
- Users with `status: 'pending'` cannot log in
- Clear error messages for different account states:
  - Pending: "Your account is pending admin approval. Please wait for approval before logging in."
  - Inactive: "Your account is not active. Please contact an administrator."

### 3. Admin Approval Endpoints Added

#### Get Pending Users
```
GET /api/admin/pending-users
```
Returns list of users awaiting approval (admin only)

#### Approve User
```
POST /api/admin/users/:id/approve
```
Sets user status to 'approved' allowing login (admin only)

#### Update User Status
```
PATCH /api/admin/users/:id/status
```
Body: `{"status": "pending|approved|suspended"}`
General status update endpoint (admin only)

## User Flow

### For New Users:
1. User registers via `/api/register`
2. Account created with `status: 'pending'`
3. User receives message: "Registration successful. Your account is pending approval by an administrator."
4. User cannot log in until approved

### For Admins:
1. Admin logs in and accesses user management
2. Admin views pending users via `/api/admin/pending-users`
3. Admin approves users via `/api/admin/users/:id/approve`
4. User can now log in successfully

### For Approved Users:
1. User attempts login
2. System checks account status
3. If `status: 'approved'` or `status: 'active'`, login succeeds
4. If `status: 'pending'`, login fails with approval message

## Database Status Values
- `pending`: Newly registered, awaiting admin approval
- `approved`: Admin approved, can log in
- `active`: Legacy active status, can log in
- `suspended`: Admin suspended, cannot log in

## API Testing

### Test Registration (No Auto-Login):
```bash
curl -X POST http://your-server:5000/api/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"newuser","password":"pass123","firstName":"New","lastName":"User","email":"new@example.com"}'
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Registration successful. Your account is pending approval by an administrator.",
  "username": "newuser",
  "status": "pending"
}
```

### Test Login (Pending User):
```bash
curl -X POST http://your-server:5000/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"newuser","password":"pass123"}'
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Your account is pending admin approval. Please wait for approval before logging in."
}
```

### Test Admin Approval:
```bash
# First login as admin, then:
curl -b cookies.txt -X POST http://your-server:5000/api/admin/users/USER_ID/approve
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
  "message": "User approved successfully",
  "user": { /* approved user object */ }
}
```

## Production Server Status

Your production server now has:
- ✅ Node.js tsx compatibility fixed
- ✅ Finding creation working
- ✅ Registration endpoints working
- ✅ User approval workflow implemented

The user approval system ensures new registrations require admin review before access is granted, maintaining security while allowing self-service registration.
